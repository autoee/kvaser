The linux developer kit from www.kvaser.com does not work well
with the latest linux kernels.  Also, at Eaton, we are only using
the Kvaser Leaf/LeafLight, so controlling the code for all the 
other interfaces is unnecessary.  This repo contains the 'canlib'
library and 'kvaser leaf' drivers from www.kvaser.com and have been
modified to build/install on the latest linux kernels (including
kernel 3.0).

use the linux standard commands to build and install

$ make
... then as root ...
# make install
